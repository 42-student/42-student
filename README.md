# Hi there, I'm Sebastian! 👋

🎓 I'm currently studying **Software Engineering** at **42 Berlin**.
🚀 I’m passionate about building things that work (eventually) and learning from the inevitable bugs along the way.
💡 I dabble in low-level programming, system design, and algorithms, basically, I enjoy making computers suffer with efficiency. I also do some high-level programming when I feel like giving myself a break.
🤖 As for AI, I’d love to learn more about it, mostly because everyone won’t stop talking about it.
💰 Crypto and Blockchain? Well, I hear it can make you rich, so why not give it a shot before the next market crash?
#### 📚 Always learning and exploring new things in the world of **computer science**.

## 🌌 More Stuff...
- **Longest Quest**: Mastering the art of pointers in C without summoning a segmentation fault demon.
- **Favorite Algorithm**: Bubble Sort, because sometimes you just need to watch the world sort slowly.
- **Dream Project**: A self-healing Docker container that fixes its own bugs (a guy can dream, right?).

  I’m also experimenting with **Linux** to feel like a terminal wizard.
